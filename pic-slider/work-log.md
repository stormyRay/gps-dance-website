* Initilize the basic HTML structure, which should be dynamically generated by JS.
* Test the CSS for the container.
* Create JS file or testing the animation using native javascript.

* Change the move function input from distance to target position, to adapt the further using situation.
* Add step calculation, which makes the moving more 'smooth' (Tween moving alike).

*****************************************************************

2017-01-15
* Define wrapper class as "PicSlider".
* Define method of setting group position of the given HTML.
* Complete move events (mouseover & mouseout).
* Add previous and next area without event handler for now.

*****************************************************************

* Minor change on the expansion mode, which makes the slider expandes itself from the center, not only on one side.
* Add clicking event for each picture/item. User can "expand"/"collpse" each picture by clicking it.

******************************************************************

2017-01-21
* Add prototype function for appending DOM, which prepares for the DOM building functon for the whole class.

*****************************************************************

* Complete DOM building logic, based on the options (name + image name).
* Add mouse events for "previous" and "next" button for a scrolling action.
* ~~**Current shortcome:** All the images are aligned to left, which means in the "collapsed" status, we cannot focus the centeral content. And that is on contrary of the purpose of the slider.~~
- ~~Plan to do: change \<img\> into a background-img style and use the background position to control the center of the image. We'll also move the background during our moving.~~

******************************************************************

* Change moving mechanism from multiple single moving chain (multi-thread alike), to one moving chain (one thread alike). Before, we have multiple items moves at the same time (multiple setTimeInterval actions). Now we make all targets moving in one setInterval action. That will definitely reduce the system resource comsumption and weaken the "flash" during moving.
* Add "center" attribute for each image, which makes the expanding is more like from center expanded.
* Other minor changes: style adding for central expanding, avoid viewport moving after one item expanded.
