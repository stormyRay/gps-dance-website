* Initilize the basic HTML structure, which should be dynamically generated by JS.
* Test the CSS for the container.
* Create JS file or testing the animation using native javascript.

* Change the move function input from distance to target position, to adapt the further using situation.
* Add step calculation, which makes the moving more 'smooth' (Tween moving alike).

*****************************************************************

* Define wrapper class as "PicSlider".
* Define method of setting group position of the given HTML.
* Complete move events (mouseover & mouseout).
* Add previous and next area without event handler for now.

* Minor change on the expansion mode, which makes the slider expandes itself from the center, not only on one side.
* Add clicking event for each picture/item. User can "expand"/"collpse" each picture by clicking it.

******************************************************************

* Add prototype function for appending DOM, which prepares for the DOM building functon for the whole class.

*****************************************************************

* Complete DOM building logic, based on the options (name + image name).
* Add mouse events for "previous" and "next" button for a scrolling action.
* **Current shortcome:** All the images are aligned to left, which means in the "collapsed" status, we cannot focus the centeral content. And that is on contrary of the purpose of the slider.
- Plan to do: change \<img\> into a background-img style and use the background position to control the center of the image. We'll also move the background during our moving.
