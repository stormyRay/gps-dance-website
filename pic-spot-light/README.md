#pic-spot-light

This is a library written by native Javascript.
It's now an alpha version which is only applied to the G.P.S. website for a specific feature requirement. The showing is a little like a picture slider (multiple pictures' advertising or casourel), with extra functionalities according to the showing requirement.
If anyone (I mean if) sees this information and gets intrests in this feature, I'm glad to get contact with you and work together on this widget to become a strong and complex widget. I really wish this will become a formal widget applied by many people in the future.
